# Bioinfo_scripts

Repo contains scripts for Bioinfo, for every day use.
Added coding problems from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info)

* <b>DNAtoRNA</b> - Transcribes DNA sequence to RNA </br>
Given a DNA string, its transcribed to RNA string.


* <b>DNAcomplement</b> - Converts a DNA sequence into its reverse </br>
Given a DNA string, gives the complement strand.


* <b>DNAreverse</b> -  Direction from its 3′- to its 5′-end. </br>
Given a DNA string, returns the strand from the 3' to 5' oritentation.


* <b>DNAreverse_complement</b> - The complementary strand of a DNA sequence. </br>
Given a DNA string, gives the complement strand keeping the 5' and 3' ends properly oriented.


* <b>countDNA</b> - Counts DNA Nucleotides </br>
Given a DNA string, counts the total and the respective number of times that the nucleotides "A", "C", "G", "T" occurs.
