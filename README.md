# Bioinfo_scripts

Repo contains scripts for Bioinfo, for every day use.
Added coding problems from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info)

* DNAtoRNA - Transcribes DNA sequence to RNA
Given a DNA string, its transcribed to RNA string.


* countDNA - Counts DNA Nucleotides
Given a DNA string, counts the total and the respective number of times that the nucleotides "A", "C", "G", "T" occurs.


* DNAcomplement - Converts a DNA sequence into its reverse
Given a DNA string, gives the complement strand.


* DNAreverse -  Direction from its 3′- to its 5′-end.
Given a DNA string, returns the strand from the 3' to 5' oritentation.


* DNAreverse_complement - The complementary strand of a DNA sequence
Given a DNA string, gives the complement strand keeping the 5' and 3' ends properly oriented.
